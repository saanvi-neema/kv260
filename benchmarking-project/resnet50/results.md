# ResNet50 Benchmark Results

## Platform: KV260 (Ubuntu 22.04, kernel 5.15.0-1027)
## Model: ResNet50 (image classification, 1000 classes, input 224x224)

| Metric | CPU (ARM Cortex-A53) | DPU (B512) | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| FPS | 1.59 | 92.1–95.7 | **58–60x faster** |
| Latency (ms/frame) | 629.1 | 10.5–10.9 | **58–60x lower** |
| Power (Watts) | 4.35 | 8.15–8.72 | ~2x more |
| FPS/Watt | 0.37 | 10.56–11.74 | **29–32x more efficient** |

> Two confirmed runs: Run 1 (script, 2026-06-12): 92.1 FPS, 10.56 FPS/Watt. Run 2 (notebook, 2026-06-13): 95.7 FPS, 11.74 FPS/Watt. Both consistent — variation is normal.

## Notes
- Power measured via INA260 sensor at `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/power1_input`
- CPU uses ONNX Runtime 1.23.2 with CPUExecutionProvider
- DPU uses pynq-dpu with B512 bitstream (dpu.bit from Kria-PYNQ package)
- Same model architecture, different runtime/hardware
- CPU ran 20 frames (fewer to avoid overheating), DPU ran 100 frames

## How to Reproduce

### Prerequisites
1. Kria-PYNQ installed on KV260 (see `../SETUP.md`)
2. Run `bash ../setup_all.sh` to copy models and install onnxruntime

### Run via Jupyter (recommended — step by step)
Open in browser: `http://<board-ip>:9090/lab` password: `xilinx`
- DPU: open `dpu_bench.ipynb` → Run All Cells
- CPU: open `cpu_bench.ipynb` → Run All Cells

### Run via script
```bash
# DPU (from Jupyter terminal — pynq venv required)
source /etc/profile.d/pynq_venv.sh
python3 /home/ubuntu/dpu_benchmark/resnet50/dpu_bench.py

# CPU (from any terminal)
python3 /home/ubuntu/dpu_benchmark/resnet50/cpu_bench.py
```

### Files needed
- `models/resnet50-v1-7.onnx` (98MB) — CPU model ✅ included
- `models/dpu_resnet50.xmodel` (25MB) — DPU model ✅ included
- `../shared/dpu.bit` (7MB) — FPGA bitstream ✅ included

## Gotchas

### 1. CPU overheats at high frame counts
ResNet50 on ARM CPU runs at 100% load — keep `N_BENCHMARK=20` max.
The board crashed once when we tried 50 frames with simultaneous model download.
**Always download the model separately first, then benchmark.**

### 2. DPU must run from Jupyter, not bare terminal
Python 3.10 mmap differences cause a silent infinite hang in bare terminal.
Always run DPU notebooks from `http://<board-ip>:9090/lab`.

### 3. Check CMA before running DPU
```bash
cat /proc/meminfo | grep Cma   # CmaFree must be >500MB
```
If low — reboot. Each failed DPU load leaks CMA; after ~5 failures it hangs forever.

### 4. pynq venv required for DPU
```bash
source /etc/profile.d/pynq_venv.sh   # required before running DPU scripts
```
System Python has NumPy 2.x which conflicts with pynq compiled modules.

### 5. ResNet50 ONNX model wget fails (GitHub LFS)
The ONNX model zoo uses Git LFS — wget gets a 0-byte pointer file, not the real model.
Download via browser: click "Download raw file" on GitHub, or use `setup_all.sh` which
copies from the included `models/` directory.

### 6. Board WiFi dropped during download + benchmark simultaneously
Running heavy CPU inference while downloading the 98MB model over WiFi caused a crash.
**Always separate download from benchmarking** — `setup_all.sh` handles this correctly.

### 7. apt vitis-ai-runtime crashes with SIGSEGV — do not use
We tried installing the Ubuntu universe package first:
```bash
# DO NOT DO THIS:
sudo apt install vitis-ai-runtime
```
It crashes with `SIGSEGV` in `tools_extra_ops.cpython-310.so` on kernel 5.15.0-1027.
Root cause: C++ ABI mismatch between the 2022-compiled package and the 2024 kernel.
**Use Kria-PYNQ instead** — that's the only working path on Ubuntu 22.04.
